## Project Development Phase

Welcome to the development phase of the Potato Classification Project. In this phase, we will focus on building and implementing the Potato classification system based on the planning details outlined in the planning phase.

### Table of Contents

Development Phase
Within the Development Phase, we will actively progress with the implementation of the potato disease classification model, building upon the blueprint formulated during the Planning Phase. This phase encompasses the following crucial elements:

### Dataset
This section showcases images of various potato diseases, such as early blight, late blight,and healthly. These images are fundamental to our project, serving for classification, analysis, and visualization purposes. They are categorized by disease type for convenient accessibility and utilization in development, testing, and related project activities.

### Flask Source Code
Here, you will find the Flask source code for the "Potato Disease Classification Project." This code includes route definitions, view functions, HTML templates, and Flask configurations. It is indispensable for comprehending how Flask powers the project's web application.


### Project Manual

The Project Manual serves as a foundational document for the Potato Disease Classification Project, offering clear objectives, methodologies, and best practices. It establishes roles and responsibilities, ensuring a systematic approach and fostering a shared vision for the successful development of a potato disease classification system.

The manual consists of the following sections:

Data Preparation for Potato Disease Classification
- Provides guidance on acquiring the dataset and organizing potato disease images, which is essential for data preparation.
 
Data Pre-processing for Potato Disease Classification

- Explains how to import and configure the ImageDataGenerator library to effectively process the data, both for training and testing datasets.

Model Construction for Potato Disease Classification

- Offers detailed instructions for creating, compiling, and training a pre-trained model tailored for potato disease classification. This section also covers the monitoring of validation loss and testing the model with custom inputs.

Building a Flask Application for Potato Disease Classification

- Details the process of developing a Flask-based web application and creating an HTML page to deploy the potato disease classification model, ensuring practical usability and accessibility.
