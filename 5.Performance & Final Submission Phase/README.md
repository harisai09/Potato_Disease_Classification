## Project Performance and Final Submission Phase

Welcome to the Performance Evaluation Phase of the Potato Disease Classification Project. In this phase, our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the potato disease classification system we've created, following the planning details laid out in the earlier planning phase. We will compile a final report that includes project specifics and documentation.
